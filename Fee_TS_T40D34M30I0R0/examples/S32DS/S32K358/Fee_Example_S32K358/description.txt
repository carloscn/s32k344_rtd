1. Example Description
    The example perform basic functionality of Fee driver.
    1.1 The application software functionality
            - Init MemAcc driver
            - Init Fee driver
            - Write 4 bytes data to the block 0.
            - Read 2 byte from offset 2 in the block 0.
            - Check received data.

2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - EVB: S32K3X4EVB-Q257 47827 PCB RevX1 SCH RevA. Silicon: P32K344EHVMMS BP55A CTSK2038A
            - EVB: S32K3XXEVB-Q172 47811 PCB RevX1 SCH RevB
        2.1.2 Connections
            Powered board through power Adapter 12V
        2.1.3 Debugger
            - The debugger must be connected to J52 10-pin JTAG Cortex Debug connector.
    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            - After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select this example. Then click on "Finish".
            - The project should now be copied into your current workspace.
         
3. Generating, building and running the example application
    3.1 Generating the S32 configuration
        - Before running the example, a configuration needs to be generated.
        - First go to Project Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project.
        - Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Clocks, Peripherals, etc).
        - Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
        - Make the desired changes (if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool -> Update Code" button.
    3.2 Compiling the application
        - Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM), or FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        - Use Project > Build to build the project.
        - Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
        - Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board
        - Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:
        
            Configuration Name                           Description
            -------------------------------              ----------------------------------------
            Fee_Example_S32K358_debug_RAM_PNE            Debug the RAM configuration using PEmicro probe
            Fee_Example_S32K358_debug_FLASH_PNE          Debug the FLASH configuration using PEmicro probe
        
        - Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
        - Use the controls to control the program flow.
