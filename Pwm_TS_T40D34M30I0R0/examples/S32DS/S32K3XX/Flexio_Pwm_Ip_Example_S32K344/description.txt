1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of a subset of Real Time Drivers that are included in this code drop. It is not part of the production code deliverables.
    The application includes a Design Studio project, that uses predefined configurations for the IP layer only (Siul2_Port_Ip, IntCtrl and Flexio_Mcl_Ip, Flexio_Mcl_Ip...).
    1.1 The application software functionality
        - Initialize clock.
        - Initialize Suil2_Port driver.
        - Initialize Flexio_Mcl_Ip driver.
        - Initialize Flexio_Pwm_Ip driver.
        - Using basic functionality of Flexio_Pwm_Ip driver to control the LED.
2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - S32K3X4EVB-Q257 47827 PCB RevX1 SCH RevA. 
            - S32K3X4EVB-Q172 51972 PCB RevA SCH RevA.
        2.1.2 Connections
            PTA31(FLEXIO_D0) will control the LED(RGBLED0_BLUE), control the led brightness and blink this Led.
        2.1.3 Debugger
            The OpenSDA debugger must be connected to J40 JTAG Cortex Debug connector for S32K3X4EVB-Q172 51972 PCB RevA SCH RevA boards.
            The OpenSDA debugger must be connected to J55 Cortex Debug connector in board S32K3X4EVB-Q257 47827 PCB RevX1 SCH RevA.
    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select this example. Then click on "Finish".
            The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
         
3. Generating, building and running the example application
    3.1 Generating the S32 configuration
        Before running the example a configuration needs to be generated.  First go to Project Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project. 
        Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Cocks, Peripherals etc...). 
        Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components. 
        Make the desired changes (if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Use Project > Build to build the project.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board
        Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:

        Configuration Name                  Description
        -------------------------------     -----------------------
        $(example)_debug_flash_pemicro      Debug the FLASH configuration using PEmicro probe

        Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
