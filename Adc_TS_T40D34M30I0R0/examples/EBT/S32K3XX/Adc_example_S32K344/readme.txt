1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of the Adc Driver by Interrupt and DMA Transfer.
        The application includes an EB Tresos project that configures the Mcu, Mcl Platform and Adc drivers.
    If all returned status and converted results are correct, the bStatus variable remains "TRUE" until end of the example.
    1.1 The application software functionality
        The example is divided in 3 parts:
        - Part 1: Example with SW Triggered One-Shot Conversion Mode, data conversion is updated by Interrupt.
        - Part 2: Example with BCTU controlled mode conversion by Interrupt.
        - Part 3: Example with SW Triggered One-Shot Conversion Mode, data conversion is updated by DMA.
        - Mcu_Init, Mcu_InitClock, Mcu_SetMode
                Initialize the clock sources, the clock tree and to configure the clock gating of the peripherals.
                The clock configuration that is used will enable and use the PLL as source clock.
        - Mcl_Init
                Initialize the Mcl Driver: Initialize the DMA Logic Instance and DMA Logic Channel 0.
                Logic Channel 0 is configured in EB Tresos to run in Scatter/Gather Mode, enables DMAMUX with source is DMA_IP_REQ_MUX1_SARADC1.
        - Platform_Init
                Initialize the interrupt controller and to apply the interrupt configuration according to the Platform configuration.
        - Platform_SetIrq
                Enables interrupt request of Adc Hardware Instance 0, BCTU Hardware unit 0 and DMA transfer complete Channel 1.
        - Platform_InstallIrqHandler
                Install the ISR for the Adc Hardware Instance 0, BCTU Hardware unit 0 and DMA transfer complete Channel 1.
        - Adc_Init
                Initialize the Adc Driver: Initialize the Adc Hardware Instances and BCTU Hardware Instance.
        - Adc_Calibrate
                Enable calibration functionality of Adc Hardware Instances.
        - Adc_SetupResultBuffer
                Initializes ADC driver with the group specific result buffer start address (ResultBuffer and ResultBufferDma) where the
                conversion results will be stored.
        - Adc_EnableGroupNotification
                Enables the notification mechanism for the requested ADC Channel group.
        - Adc_StartGroupConversion
                Starts the conversion of all channels of the requested ADC Channel group.
        - Adc_ReadGroup
                Reads the group conversion result of the last completed conversion round of the
                requested group and stores the channel values starting at the AdcReadGroupResult address.
        - Adc_EnableCtuControlMode
                Enables the control mode functionality of BCTU Hardware unit 0.
        - Adc_CtuStartConversion
                Start conversion of a BCTU trigger source
        - Adc_CtuReadConvData
                Read data from BCTU CDR register.
        - Adc_DisableCtuControlMode
                Disables the control mode functionality of BCTU Hardware unit 0.
        - Adc_DeInit
                Returns all ADC HW Units to a state comparable to their power on reset state.
        - Verification criteria for a successful example run is bStatus being TRUE at the end of the example.

    3.3 Running the application on the board
        To execute the example application from your command line execute make run. For executing the script in a T32 window already open the paths from run.cmm need to be changed relative to the debug folder instead of the example root folder.
    3.4 Modifying the configuration in Tresos and generating the code
        Users may change the application configuration according to their needs.
        Procedure:
            1. Open the EB Tresos Studio GUI
