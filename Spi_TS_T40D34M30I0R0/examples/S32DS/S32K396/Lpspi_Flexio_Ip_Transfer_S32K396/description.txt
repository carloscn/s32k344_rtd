1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of a subset of Real Time Drivers that are included in this code drop. It is not part of the production code deliverables.
    The application includes a Design Studio project, that uses predefined configurations for the IP layer only (Clock, Pin, Siul2, OsIf, Lpspi, Flexio_Spi, IntCtrl).
    The application uses the LPSPI and FLEXIO_SPI drivers to transfer data between LPSPI_2 and FLEXIO_SPI_0 physical units.

                    Initializes the LPSPI physical unit with its configuration data on SpiPhyUnit.
            - Flexio_Spi_Ip_Init
                    Initializes the FLEXIO physical unit with its configuration data on SpiPhyUnit.
            - Lpspi_Ip_UpdateFrameSize
                    Configure number of bits per an transfer for Lpspi instance.
            - Flexio_Spi_Ip_UpdateFrameSize
                    Configure number of bits per an transfer for Flexio_Spi instance.
            - Lpspi_Ip_UpdateLsb
                    Last or most significal bit is transfer first for Lpspi instance.
            - Flexio_Spi_Ip_UpdateLsb
                    Last or most significal bit is transfer first for Flexio_Spi instance.
            - Flexio_Spi_Ip_UpdateTransferMode
                    Select polling or interrupt mode in transfer.
            - Flexio_Spi_Ip_AsyncTransmit
                    The slave sets up hardware and wait master start transfer.
            - Lpspi_Ip_SyncTransmit
                    The master set up hardware and start transfer with the slave by synchronous mode.

    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Importing the S32 Design Studio project
            After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select "Lpsi_Flexio_Ip_Transfer_S32K344". Then click on "Finish".
            The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
         
3. Building the example application
    3.1 Generation the code by switch to Peripherals/Pin/Clock tools and click the button "Update Code"
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM), or FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse. 
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, Lpsi_Flexio_Ip_Transfer_S32K344.elf binary file
        should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board in one of two ways below:
        3.3.1 To execute the example application load the executable file to the evaluation board using the Lauterbach debugger and the s32k3xx.cmm script.
        Open the cmm script in a text editor and replace the following strings:
            - __TARGET_MEMORY - replace with RAM (for RAM configuration), or FLASH (for FLASH configuration)
            - __PATH_TO_ELF - replace with the path to the elf binary files built with S32 DS
        Run this script using T32 Lauterbach debugger after making the changes.
        3.3.2 Click button "Run" or "Debug" on S32 Design Studio.
