    @brief Example application showing CDD_I2s usage

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    This application demonstrates the usage of the I2s Driver over Flexio hardware Ip.
    The application includes a S32DS project that configures the Mcu, Mcl, Port and Platform drivers.
    The application software functionality:
    - Mcu_Init, Mcu_InitClock, Mcu_SetMode
        Initialize the clock sources, the clock tree and to configure the clock gating of the peripherals.
    - OsIf_Init
        Initialize the OsIf for I2s internal delay.
    - Platform_Init
        Initialize the interrupt controller and to apply the interrupt configuration according to the Platform configuration.
    - Platform_SetIrq
        Enables interrupt request of Flexio and Dma.
    - Platform_InstallIrqHandler
        Install the ISR for the Flexio and Dma.
    - Port_Init
        Initialize Port pins for 2 Flexio Channels according to Master and Slave Channels
    - Mcl_Init
        Initialize Mcl driver to configure Flexio hardware
    - I2s_Init
        Initialization of I2s driver.
        I2s over Flexio Master uses Interrupt mode
        I2s over Flexio Slave uses Interrupt mode
    - I2s_AsyncTransmit/I2s_SyncTransmit for transferring data
        Master sends data, Slave receives data
    - I2s_GetStatus
        Gets the status of an Flexio Channels.
    - The application will verify in the received data corresponds with the sent data and update the status flag bStatus accordingly.
    - I2s_DeInit
        De-initialization of I2s modules to reset values

    ## How to run ##
    ______
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New \b S32DS \b Project \b From... and select \b I2s_Flexio_example_S32K358. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    #### 2. Generating the S32 configuration ####
    The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
    The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
    First go to \b Project \b Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project(\b I2s_Flexio_example_S32K358).
    Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Clocks, Peripherals, etc.). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
    Make the desired changes(if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b RAM (Debug_RAM) or FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be one debug configurations for this project:
     Configuration Name                               | Description
     -------------------------------------------------|------------
     \b I2s_Flexio_example_S32K344_Debug_FLASH_PNE    | Debug the FLASH configuration using GDB PEMicro

    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.
