1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of the Mcl Driver.
    The application includes an EB Tresos project that configures the Mcu and Platform drivers.
    1.1 The aplication software functionality
            - Mcu_Init, Mcu_InitClock, Mcu_DistributePllClock, Mcu_SetMode
                    Initialize the clock sources, the clock tree and to configure the clock gating of the peripherals.
                    The clock configuration that is used will enable and use the PLL as source clock.
            - Platform_Init
                    Initialize the interrupt controller and to apply the interrupt configuration according to the Platform configuration.
            - Platform_InstallIrqHandler
                    Install the ISR for the DMA Logic Channel 0, Logic Channel 1 and Logic Channel 2.
            - Mcl_Init
                    Initialize the Mcl Driver: Initialize the DMA Logic Instance and DMA Logic Channel 0, Logic Channel 1 and Logic Channel 2.
                    Logic Channel 0 is configured in EB Tresos to run in Normal Transfer Mode.
                    Logic Channel 1 is configured in EB Tresos to run in Scatter/Gather Mode.
                    Logic Channel 2 is configured runtime to run in Normal Transfer Mode.
            - Mcl_SetDmaChannelTransferList
                    Configures at runtime, the selected Logic Channel, with Normal Transfer Mode Source Address and Destination Address parameters.
            - Mcl_SetDmaChannelScatterGatherList
                    Configures at runtime, the selected Logic Element of the selected Logic Channel, with Scatter/Gather Mode Source Address and Destination Address parameters.
            - Mcl_SetDmaChannelCommand
                    Sets specific command for the selected Logic Channel.
            - Mcl_CacheInvalidateByAddr
                    Invalidates the specified buffer in Cache. The buffer shall be 32 bytes aligned.
			- Validation Point 
					Status = True (Verify that the Mcl/Dma result returned corresponds to the expected value)

    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Tresos Project Installation
            The following procedure requires that the user has EB Tresos Studio installed and it is only needed for viewing, updating and generating the driver's configuration.
            Procedure:
                1. Make sure that all RTD plugins are already installed in the Tresos Studio plugins directory
                2. Open Tresos Studio
                3. Import example application project
                    a. Click on "File" and select "Import"
                    b. Select "Existing Projects into Workspace" and click on "Next" button
                    c. Select "Select root directory" and click on "Browse"
                    d. Select the location of the [project] folder in the installed example application package folder
                    e. Optional* - Select "Copy projects into workspace"
                    f. Click on "Finish" button
        2.2.2 Example configuration
            The following procedure requires that the user has EB Tresos Studio installed and the toolchains versions specified in the Release Notes.
            The toolchain that will be used needs to be installed for correct operation and the path to the installation location shall be added into the system environment variable(s):
            - TRESOS_DIR the installation path of Electrobit Tresos (used for generating the project from command line)
                Ex: TRESOS_DIR = C:/EB/tresos26
            - GCC_DIR The path to the GCC instalation dir
                Ex: GCC_DIR = C:/NXP/S32DS.3.3/S32DS/build_tools/gcc_v9.2/gcc-9.2-arm32-eabi
            - PLUGINS_DIR The path to the RTD plugins directory
                Ex: PLUGINS_DIR = C:/NXP/SW32_RTD/eclipse/plugins
            Procedure:
                1. Open project_parameters.mk file in a text editor and update the variables mentioned above with the correct paths
3. Building the example application
    3.1 Generating the Tresos project
        Procedure:
               1. Open the Windows command prompt window
               2. Change the current directory to the example application folder
               3. To generate the Tresos project of the example, execute the following command to build: make generate
               4. The output files of the generation shall be generated in the /generate subdirectory
   3.2 Compiling the application
        Procedure:
           1. Open the Windows command prompt window
           2. Change the current directory to the example application folder
           3. To build the example, execute the following command to build: make build
           4. The object files and linker output file (main.elf) shall be generated in the /out subdirectory
   3.3 Running the application on the board
       To execute the example application from your command line execute make run. For executing the script in a T32 window already open the paths from run.cmm need to be changed relative to the debug folder instead of the example root folder.
