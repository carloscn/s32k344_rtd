1. Example Description
    This application demonstrates the usage of a the Resource Manager HLD.
    The application includes an S32DS project that configures the Rm driver.
    1.1 The application software functionality
        - Initialize Application (Clock and CDD RM)
            Configure CDD RM - Virtual Wrapper with two pin PDAC1 access types
                - PDAC1 M7_0_0 is configured with full access right by XRDC
                - PDAC1 M7_0_1 is configured with no access right by XRDC
        - Try to access by MSCR register of SIUL2 through PDAC1 M7_0_0
            This action performs successfully and MSCR register can be wrote
        - Try to access by MSCR register of SIUL2 through PDAC1 M7_0_1
            This action does not perform successfully and MSCR register value is unchanged
            An hardfault occurs and error details can be captured by XRDC registers
2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation

            - S32K3X4EVB-Q172 51972 PCB RevA SCH RevA. Silicon: P32K344EHVPBS 1P55A CTZX2128B
        2.1.2 Connections
            - Powered board through power Adapter 12V
        2.1.3 Debugger
            - For S32K3X4EVB-Q257 47827 PCB RevX1 SCH RevA:
                - The probe must be connected to J55 - Micro USB - OpenSDA.
            - For S32K3XXEVB-Q172 51972 PCB RevA  SCH RevA:
                - The probe must be connected to J40 - Micro USB - OpenSDA.
    2.2 Software installation
        - Make sure that all RTD plugins are already installed in the S32DS plugins directory
3. How to run
    3.1 Importing the project into the workspace
        After opening S32 Design Studio, go to "File -> New -> S32DS Project From Example" and select "Rm_Virt_Wrap_Example_S32K358". Then click on "Finish".
        The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
        Wait for the S32 Configuration was initialized and ready.
    3.2 Generating the S32 configuration
        The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
        The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
        Right click on the current project, then click "S32 Configuration Tool" choose "Open Peripherals".
        Pay attention to any error and warning message. If any configured value is invalid, they will be shown for user.
        Make the desired changes (if any) then click "Update Code".
    3.3 Building the project
            Select the configuration to be built: RAM (Debug_RAM), or FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
            Use Project > Build to build the project.
            Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file should be created.
    3.4 Running the project
            Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:

            Configuration Name                                      Description
            -------------------------------                         -----------------------
            Rm_Virt_Wrapper_Example_S32K344_Debug_RAM_PNE           Debug the RAM configuration using PEmicro probe
            Rm_Virt_Wrapper_Example_S32K344_Debug_FLASH_PNE         Debug the FLASH configuration using PEmicro probe

            Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
            Use the controls to control the program flow.
